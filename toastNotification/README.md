# Toast Notification Project
This project is an application that shows the user success, error and invalid messages and notifications (toast). It offers a feature where each message appears on the screen for a certain period of time and then disappears. In addition, the messages appear on the screen in an animated manner and each toast notification is supported by Font Awesome icons.
